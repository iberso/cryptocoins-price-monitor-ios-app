# cryptocoins-price-monitor-ios-app

I made this application to fulfill my final semester exam assignments for iOS-based development courses. In this project I use a tableview with a custom cell, where each custom cell displays the symbol, name, image, and current price of each crypto coin. The data is taken from the API https://rapidapi.com/coingecko/api/coingecko/ and the service used is GET /coins/markets (only 1-100 data).
